üü¢ 1. What happens without Docker?
If you're not using Docker, your friend must:

Install Python

Install PostgreSQL (if you're using a database)

Install all required libraries (usually via pip install -r requirements.txt)

Make sure everything matches (versions, OS compatibility, etc.)

Run your project manually (e.g., uvicorn main:app --reload)

‚úÖ This works, but it's fragile, hard to replicate, and depends on their environment.

üê≥ 2. What happens with Docker?
If you Dockerize your FastAPI project (and the database using docker-compose), then:

You give your friend only:

The project folder (with your FastAPI app, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.)

Instructions to:
‚úÖ Install Docker Desktop
‚úÖ Run: docker-compose up --build in the project folder

üê≥ 2. What happens with Deploy?
The process of putting your app on the internet


üéâ Database Migration
Definition: Moving or changing the structure of a database.

Examples:

Adding a new column to a table.

Renaming , adding or deleting a table.

Moving data from one database system (e.g., MySQL) to another (e.g., PostgreSQL).

Alembic migrations change your database schema (like adding tables or columns) without deleting your data or recreating the whole database.

You can safely update your database structure as your models change.
Existing data is preserved unless your migration specifically drops or alters tables/columns in a destructive way.
This is the main advantage of using Alembic for database migrations in production projects.
Summary:
Alembic lets you evolve your database schema over time without losing important information.

pip install alembic
# Initialize Alembic

To set up Alembic in your project, run:

```bash
alembic init alembic
```

This creates an `alembic` directory and a configuration file.

# Run Alembic Migrations

After making changes to your models or database schema:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Describe your change"

"""Creates a new migration file by comparing your models to the current database.
--autogenerate tells Alembic to detect changes automatically. -m Add Describe your change adds a message describing the migration."""

alembic upgrade head 

"""Applies the latest migration(s) to your database. head means the most recent migration (the "top" of the migration history)."""
```
